        Now let's talk images. Have you seen this video showing how much the New York Times' front page has changed since 1852?
        Long story short, images are an important part of modern web design! We run into some interesting problems with them in
        HTML/CSS.Let's get some cat pictures on the screen. Create a new div with class 'image-1-container' and give it a fixed width of
        200px and a fixed height of 600px. Also give it a colored background so we can actually see it (you get to pick the
        color this time). Inside of this new div, create an img tag that points to the file called cat.jpg that's in the assets
        folder.
        Note that the image spills out of the div. By default, images will want to render with the full glorious dimensions. How
        can we combat this brash egotism? Tell the image to obey the constraints of its container by giving it a width of 100%.
        NB: You may be wondering, "100% of what". From the results of this experiment, you should be able to infer that width
        percentages are determined by the width of one's parent.
        Make a copy of your image-1-container and paste it below the original. Change this copy's class but give it the same
        styles as the original. Make sure that the new image is back to it's old image ways and bursting out of its container
        (If it's not, you weren't specific enough with your style rules for the last image and you should go fix them).
        Alter the styling on this new container so that it's width still defaults to 200px but now it can grow to accomodate any
        image. Hint hint, it's something you used earlier to accomodate your other children. Remember that div elements are
        blocks and will take up the whole width of the window if you don't constrain them, so you might want to change them to
        inline-blocks or something.
        Margin is the only property of margin, border, and padding that does not affect the size of the box itself. Instead
        margin is the "private space" a box needs around it. For example, if you set margin-left: 50px on a tag, then the box
        that tag renders will have nothing in the 50px to the left of it. The box will "move itself over" to ensure that this
        space is respected.
        
        Margin is not additive. This means if two boxes next to each other request 50px of margin, there will be 50px between
        them, not 100px.
        
        Padding
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="forth-div" class="image-1-container">
      <img src="./assets/cat.jpg"/> 
    </div>
    <div id="forth-div" class="image-2-container">
      <img src="./assets/cat.jpg" />
    </div>
    <p>What if we don't want the padding and border to be added on top of the width, but rather be included in the total width
    calculation? We can accomplish this by setting the box-sizing property to border-box. Do this for the second box and
    note the results. Note how the content box has shrunken to allow room for the padding and border. NB: The default value
    for the box-sizing property is content-box.
    Do box elements always need a set height and width to be visible? No! Play around with adding text into the p element
    and</p>
